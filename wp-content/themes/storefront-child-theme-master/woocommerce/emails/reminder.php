 * HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.

<p>
This email is to remind you that you are signed up to attend our online <?= esc_html( $class_name_friendly ); ?> class with <?= esc_html( $instructor ); ?> on <?= esc_html( $class_date ); ?>! Class will begin at <?= esc_html( $class_time ); ?> PT and will run for about 2-2.5 hours. The virtual waiting room will open about 10 minutes before class, so plan to get there a bit early to make sure you're good-to-go.</p>	

<p>There are a few things to prepare ahead of class:</p>

<?php echo $prep_instructions; ?>

<p>Here is your <a href="<?php echo $packet; ?>">class packet</a> to help you get set up, we suggest that you read it over now! We also suggest having the class packet handy when class begins, as weâ€™ll reference it quite a bit throughout. You can also view the <a href="<?php echo $list_link; ?>">shopping list</a> to get prepped for class! (Please note that the link for the recipe packet above will expire one week after class. If you would like to keep it, please make sure you download a copy!)</p>
