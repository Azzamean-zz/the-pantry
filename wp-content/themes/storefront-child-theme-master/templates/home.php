                    <p>Here at the Pantry, we call ourselves a community kitchen. For us, that means we do many things: cooking classes focusing on traditional food crafts and technique, five-course family-style dinners, culinary camp for the kids, power lunches for makers, food swaps, and cookbook club potluck suppers. Basically anything we can think of to get our neighbors around the table, breaking bread and building community.<span></span><br></p>
                    <p>We love welcoming you into our kitchen — but with the safety and welfare of our community and our staff at the forefront of our minds,<strong>&nbsp;we have suspended our in-person classes until we can be assured that it’s once again safe to gather together around our tables.</strong>&nbsp;Since that won't stop us from hanging out with you, we've taken our <a href="https://thepantryseattle.com/events/classes">classes</a> online! Join us for our new&nbsp;interactive cooking classes held in your own home, through Zoom.</p>
                    <p>And while we will miss breaking bread with you in person, we see no reason to stop feeding you! <strong>We’ve turned our favorite dishes into pop-ups, serving take-away versions of that menu.</strong> Each <a href="https://thepantryseattle.com/events/togomeals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to go meal</a> is made family style with care and love (and lots of hand-washing) by the Pantry’s chefs and instructors.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>As we’ve been busy preparing meals, we’ve also recognized the gap in services that are out there for some of our most vulnerable populations. We are now donating (and delivering) meals to Gifts of Hope and Edible Hope. To learn more about our mission, please visit our <a href="https://thepantryseattle.com/our-community">community</a> page.</p>
